# Converting Vagrant images to VirtualBox and Eucalyptus images

(protocol steps tested in Ubuntu Natty)

## software pre-requisite

    sudo gem install vagrant
    sudo apt-get install cloud-utils

## Importing cloud biolinux VM to your system

    vagrant box add base 
    https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudbiolinux/cbl_ubuntu_11_4_32_20110628.box
    vagrant init base
    vagrant up

## adding some missing components to the vagrant VMs 

    vagrant ssh
    sudo apt-get install gdm cloud-utils openssh
    sudo useradd -d /home/ubuntu -m ubuntusudo passwd ubuntu
    sudo shutdown -r now

in the graphical login after reboot get in with user:ubuntu / pass:ubuntu
go to System--->Administration--->Login Window to enable autologin

## making a virtualbox appliance

open the Virtualbox GUI, you should see the VM added by vagrant - you can 
rename it to "Cloud BioLinux 32"
do File->Export Appliance
distribute the .ova you get from this operation
anyone in any OS can import the .ova with File->Import Appliance on their 
Virtualbox

## making a Eucalyptus image

we start with the Cloud BioLinux Virtualbox .vmdk (we can find its location 
in the VM properties from the Virtualbox GUI). We might want to resize the 
vmdk, since if we have set the disk of our Virtualbox VM to be 40G, we will 
end up with a Eucalyptus image of that size. The best solution I found is 
here (sort of a hack) :

http://mtnbike.org/blog/?p=29 and the same here:
http://www.my-guides.net/en/content/view/122/26/

convert to raw .img by doing

    qemu-img convert -O raw CloudBioLinux-32bit-disk1.vmdk 
    CloudBioLinux-32bit-disk1.img

folllowing the gparted operation we will have two partitions in our raw .img -
one containing the Cloud BioLinux root filesystem partition which was reduced 
in size, and one being simply un-allocated space. We want to extract the former partition, 
which will be the one we eventually deploy to Eucalyptus using the commands:


    sfdisk -l -uS CloudBioLinux-32bit.img 
    Device Boot    Start       End   #sectors  Id  System
    CloudBioLinux-32bit.img1   *      2048  34111487   34109440  83  Linux
    ....

dd if=CloudBioLinux-32bit.img of=CloudBioLinux-32bit.Eucalyptus.img skip=2048 count=34109440

finally deploy to Eucalyptus via

    uec-publish-img CloudBioLinux-32bit-disk1.img
